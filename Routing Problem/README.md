The legal path cannot overlap any obstacle.

## Features
1. (a) Read a test case called “route.txt” from an input file and complete the function of moving to next node. Report the path you have explored on the screen.

2. Input Format
   (a) The first line describes the column (6 for this case) and row numbers of the grid map.
   (b) The second line describes two points to be connected.
   (c) The third line describes the number of existing obstacles.
   (d) The following lines describe the location of each obstacle in one line. 
3. Output Format
   (a) Write your path to a file called “path.txt”. Its format is as follows.
   (b) The first line describes the path length.
   (c) The second lines describe the moves of back‐tracing from the target to the source.
