# Span Email

## Feature
1. Compute the number of occurrences for each keyword in an email and report the statistics; 
   The program needs to read in a keyword file and an email file. Run the program like:
   chkspam –k keyword_file_name –e email_file_name –oc
   where –k means the following parameter specifies a keyword file and –e means the following parameter specifies an email file and –oc means the execution of reporting occurrence statistics.
   
2. If your command contains –oc, your program has to report the statistics for the occurrences. 
   If your command contains –spam, the program has to judge if this or these files are spam emails. 
   If your command contains –oc and ‐spam, the program has to do both operations.
