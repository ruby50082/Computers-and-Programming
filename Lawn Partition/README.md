# Lawn Partition

In order to systematically maintain lawns of any shape, this company develops one efficient way to partition and manage a lawn. 
The method is to extend each horizontal line to partition a lawn into several rectangles and then sort all sub-lawns in increasing order of the y-coordinate first and then x-coordinate of each sub-lawn, 
i.e., all sub-lawns are sorted in terms of bottom boundary from bottom to top and the sub-lawns with the same bottom boundary are sorted in terms of left boundary from left to right.
